This is the main repository for the files used in building the Deep Neural Network (DNN) for the GeoVin project.

The DNN was built to automatically recognize true kissing bugs (particularly Triatoma infestans) from other insects directly from photos taken by mobile phones.

The DNN was testes using the photos submitted by citizen scientists of the GeoVin project in Argentina.
